To analyze drivers locations you should:

1) Create json file with serialized order data. Use `serialize_order` function from `utils` module. You can find example in `drivers_orders.json` file.
2) Run server on localhost (`DEBUG` setting should be equal True)
3) Open `analyze_drivers_locations.html` in you browser
4) Open file with serialized orders
5) Choose driver and order, wait for a while
